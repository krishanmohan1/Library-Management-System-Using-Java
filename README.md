The Library Management System is a Java-based application designed to manage the operations of a library. This project showcases the implementation of various fundamental concepts of Java programming, including object-oriented programming (OOP), data structures, and algorithms. The system allows users to add, search, borrow, return, and manage books and users within the library.


Features
Add Books and Users: Functionality to add new books and users to the library.
Search Books: Search for books by title, author, or ISBN.
Borrow and Return Books: Users can borrow and return books. The system manages the availability status of books.
Display All Books and Users: List all books and users currently in the library.
Sort Books: Sort books by title using the two-pointer technique.
Tools and Technologies Used
Java: Core programming language used for developing the application.
OOP Concepts: Encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction.
Data Structures: ArrayList for storing books and users.
Algorithms: Sorting using the comparator.
